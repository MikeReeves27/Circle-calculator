# Circle calculator

A basic geometry calculator for a circle. This was my first personal Python project that I made for practise. 

The program allows for a user to enter either a circle's <b>radius</b>, <b>diameter</b>, <b>circumference</b>, or <b>area</b>, and the program will then automatically calculate the other 3 fields based on their selection. It also lets them choose the decimal precision.

Another feature I added is scaling. No matter the value the user enters, the circle that is drawn to the canvas will never be less than a 100-pixel radius or larger than a 300-pixel radius. This will stop the circle from spreading too far off-screen or becoming virtually invisible altogether. However, while the circle itself will still be visible on the canvas, the proportions of its radius/area/etc will scale accordingly. (See screenshot for example)
